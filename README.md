Author: Tamara A. Tambyah, September 2020, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.

A free boundary mechanobiological model of epithelial tissues.
Key algorithms used to generate Figure 3 (b,d,f,h) and Figure 6 (b,d,f,h) in the manuscript.

MAIN_SCRIPT.m is the main script, and other functions are called from this script.
Built into the functions are the specific functions relating to Figure 3 (b,d,f,h) and and Figure 6 (b,d,f,h).
